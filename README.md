## Environment Setup:

### Prerequisites:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/piyushgarg-dev/review-app-api.git
   ```

2. Move to the backend folder:

   ```shell
   cd review-app-api
   ```

3. Install and set up Docker.

   > ⚠️ `Windows Users` with PgAdmin installed need to stop service `postgresql` from running by manually locating it in services by typing services.msc in powershell to proceed further.

4. Run Docker in the background. If you have an older version of Docker, use the following command to run the `docker-compose.yml` file in detached mode:

   ```shell
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   Otherwise, run:

   ```shell
   docker compose up -d
   ```

5. Set up the backend by running the following command:
   ```shell
   yarn
   ```

### Create a `.env.local` file in the project's root directory.

The `.env.local` file should contain the following environment variables:

```shell
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/review
JWT_SECRET=superman123
```

### Run Migrations:

Run database migrations with the following command:

```shell
yarn migrate:latest
```

### Start the Backend Server:

To start the backend server, run the following command:

```shell
yarn local
```

Congratulations! Your backend is now running at http://localhost:8000/local/graphql.
