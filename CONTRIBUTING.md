Before you begin contributing to the backend of the Review App, please ensure
you have the following prerequisites installed and configured on your local
machine:

- Docker: To set up and manage the development environment.
- Git: To clone and manage the project repository.
- Node.js and npm: To install project dependencies.
- Yarn: To manage Node.js packages effectively.

## Contributing Guidelines

We follow these guidelines for contributing:

1. Fork the backend repository to your GitHub account.

2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/review-app-api.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the backend project directory:

   ```bash
   cd review-app-api
   ```

4. Create a new branch for your contribution:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-name
   ```

5. Make your changes and ensure your code follows our coding standards and
	 practices.

6. Test your changes locally to ensure they work as expected.

7. Commit your changes with clear and concise commit messages:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add feature: your feature description"
   ```

8. Push your changes to your GitHub fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature-name
   ```

9. Create a pull request (PR) to the main repository's `main` branch.

## Setting Up the Development Environment

To set up the development environment locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the backend repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/review-app-api.git
   cd review-app-api
   ```

2. Run Docker Compose to set up the development environment:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. Install project dependencies using Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn
   ```
   ### Troubleshooting Yarn Installation(For Users Encountering Errors)

If you encounter an error related to Yarn installation, follow these steps to resolve it:

1. **Ensure Your Project is Marked as Private**: Open the `package.json` file in the root directory of your project and add the `"private": true` property if it's not already present:

   ```json
   "private": true
   ```

   This step is necessary to enable Yarn workspaces.

2. **Update the `workspaces` Field**: In your `package.json` file, make sure the `"workspaces"` field is correctly configured to specify the directories that should be treated as workspace packages. For example:

   ```json
   "workspaces": [
     "packages/*"
   ]
   ```

   Adjust the pattern to match the directory structure of your project where your workspace packages are located.

3. **Reinstall Dependencies**: After making these changes, run the following command to reinstall project dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

   This will ensure that Yarn sets up the workspace correctly.

   

By following these steps, you can resolve any issues related to Yarn workspaces and continue with the setup process.


4. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env.local` and configure the following
	 environment variables in the `.env.local` file:

   ```env
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/review
   JWT_SECRET=superman123
   ```

   You can replace `superman123` with any secret of your choice.

5. Run database migrations to set up the database:

   ```bash
   yarn migrate:latest
   ```

6. Start the local development server:

   ```bash
   yarn local
   ```

7. The backend will be up and running on port 8000.

## Submitting a Pull Request (PR)

When you're ready to submit your changes, create a pull request (PR) to the
main repository's `main` branch following our guidelines. Be sure to provide a
clear description of your changes in the PR, and one of our maintainers will
review it.
